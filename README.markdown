Collaborative git
================

Hi! Welcome to the more ambitious part of this whole shindig.

If you're reading this it means you understand how git works well enough to
collaborate with others so we're going to try to get everyone to work together
to submit their favorite GIF to one central location: here!

You'll need to be able to do the following:

1. Make changes to files in git and commit them to a branch
2. Push your changes up to your repository on Github
3. Make a pull request on Github
4. Merge a pull request on Github

Lets point you to some more resources on each of the steps.

This should have been covered on the main branch, ask for a hand if you're struggling!

You may need to set up [ssh authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
or you may need to [create a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/)
of your own and [push the files up](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

Github has a [great tutorial on pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

If there's a conflict (there probably will be) either the person making the pull request has to change
the pull request or you have to add their repository as a remote and pull down the changes so you
can fix the conflict. [Here's how Github does it](https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/)


Why do we need to know all this?
================================
What I'd love to see is a massive list of everyone's favorite GIFs here, here's one of mine to start you off:

Now it's your turn, add a gif below and push it to Github, then find a neighbor and make a pull request.
Once a few of you have all your gifs in here then make a pull request to my repository.

Remember, all of this work is on the pull_request branch.
